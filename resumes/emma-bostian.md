2. Easy to read

3. Impact statements

5. Skills
   Rule of thumb: Anything you list on your resume an interviewer will likely ask about.

Emma believes you should feature all your skills, but not overpromise. So she recommends organizing your skills by expertise.

If you have basic experience with Ruby, mark it as basic. If advanced, mark it as advanced.

6. Education
   Your education section depends on your background.

If you're a recent grad, list your relevant projects, internships, and certifications here.

If you're self-taught, leave it out. Showcase your top accomplishments instead.

Remember: Most relevant info first.

7. Certifications
   If you have any awards or certifications, add them!

Emma’s awards showcase her ability to excel in the workplace.

Emma doesn't list her certifications. But for those new to the industry, certifications are a killer way to learn new skills and beef up your resume.

She dialed in her: professional photo, job title, accomplishments & awards, etc.

This all helped her convince Spotify's recruiters she was a great fit for the role.
